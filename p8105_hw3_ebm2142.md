### Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets) 
data("instacart") 
```

#### The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.

``` r
str(instacart)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    1384617 obs. of  15 variables:
    ##  $ order_id              : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 36 36 ...

    ##  $ department            : chr  "dairy eggs" "dairy eggs" "produce" "produce" ...
    ##  - attr(*, "spec")=
    ##   .. cols(
    ##   ..   order_id = col_integer(),

    ##   ..   department = col_character()
    ##   .. )

``` r
count(instacart, aisle) %>% ungroup() %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2

    ## # ... with 124 more rows

##### *This dataset includes information about instacart orders, including items ordered, when they were ordred, and what aisle or department they come from. There are 1384617 observations of 15 variables. There are 134 aisles and the aisle with the most orders is the fresh vegetables aisle.*

#### Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
count(aisle) %>% 
mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + coord_flip() +
geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
labs(title = "Number of Orders in Aisle",
       x = "Aisle",
       y = "Number of Orders") 
```

![](p8105_hw3_ebm2142_files/figure-gfm/making%20number%20of%20orders%20plot-1.png)<!-- -->

##### *This is impossible to read because idk how to filter it yet.*

#### Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  top_n(3) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename("Aisle" = aisle, "Product" = product_name,  "Number of Orders" = n) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## Selecting by n

| Aisle                      | Product                                       | Number of Orders |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---------------: |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |             9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |             5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |             4966 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |              499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |              387 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |              336 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |               30 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |               28 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |               26 |

##### *The most commonly ordered packaged vegetables or fruits are all organic (spinach, raspberries, and blueberries). The second most commonly ordered dog food care item also appears to be organic. The most commonly ordered baking ingredients includes two types of sugar.*

#### Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table)

``` r
instacart %>% 
filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%  
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = round(mean(order_hour_of_day))) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>% 
  rename("Product Name" = product_name) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| Product Name     |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
| :--------------- | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 14 | 14 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 12 | 14 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13 | 11 | 12 | 14 | 12 | 13 | 12 |

##### *People, on average, don’t vary the time of day they order either apples or ice cream depending on the day of the week by more than about 3 hours.*

### Problem 2

#### Focus on the “Overall Health” topic. Include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”. Organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

``` r
brfss = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>% 
filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

#### In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  distinct(state, county) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n == 7) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   state     n
    ##   <chr> <int>
    ## 1 CT        7
    ## 2 FL        7
    ## 3 NC        7

##### *Three states were observed at more than 7 locations in 2002, two in the south (FL and NC) and one in the northeast (CT).*

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  distinct(state, county) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n == 7) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   state     n
    ##   <chr> <int>
    ## 1 CO        7
    ## 2 PA        7
    ## 3 SC        7

##### *Three different states were observed at more than 7 locations in 2010, one in the south (SC), one in the northeast (PA), and one in the west (CO).*

#### Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value across locations within a state.

#### Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

#### Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State
